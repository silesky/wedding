Melissa and Seth met in New Orleans, LA in February 2015. Their first date lasted nine hours, during which they sat on Seth’s couch and talked about everything. They quickly bonded over their shared love of Who Dat café, playing with dogs, and watching movies (or sleeping through them.) Seth proposed to Melissa on October 3, 2015 in her New York apartment. They didn’t tell anyone except their parents and the staff at Cafeteria until the next day.

Seth Silesky is a graduate of Purdue University with a BA in English. After college he worked on a political campaign in Chicago, taught English in Korea for a year, and travelled through Europe. In 2012, Seth moved to New Orleans to pursue his Masters degree, and ended up finding his love of programming. Seth currently works at Tulane University as a web developer for the School of Liberal Arts.

Melissa graduate from the University of Texas at Austin in 2013 with a BBA in Supply Chain Management. That summer, she started her Teach for America training; she served as a 5th grade math teacher in New Orleans for two years. In February 2015, two weeks after she started dating Seth, she was accepted to Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. She is currently in her second year at Columbia where she is in the Department of Population and Family Health with a concentration in Public Health Research.

Melisa and Seth are so excited to get married, move to Texas, and finally buy a dog together.
